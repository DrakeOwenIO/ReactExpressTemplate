# ReactExpressTemplate
A React/Express app template to help kickstart your applications!

To Run:
    1. Fork to your own github.
    2. Clone to a folder on your local machine.
    3. Navigate to root folder of the project in your terminal and run `npm install`.
    4. Run `cd server` then `node index.js` in your terminal.
    5. OPEN A NEW TERMINAL and run `cd client` then `npm start`
        - Its very important that you leave the other terminal open becasue that is where the server is running. If you don't leave it open, the server will not work.

You should now see a default react app that says "Hello from server!" running in your browser.
